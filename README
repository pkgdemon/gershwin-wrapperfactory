GNUstepWrapper
=============

GNUstepWrapper is an easy way to create GNUstep app-wrappers of non-GNUstep
binaries. It is the most useful in conjunction with Enrico Sersale's
GWorkspace environment.



INSTALL
=======

GNUstepWrapper needs a fairly current build of GNUstep installed.
Get GNUstep here: http://www.gnustep.org/

Also, a recent installation of GWorkspace.app is highly recommended.
Get GWorkspace here: http://www.gnustep.it/enrico/gworkspace/

Decompress the archive:
tar xfvz GNUstepWrapper-[Version].tar.gz

Next, compile and install the application:
$ make
# make install (as root)

GNUstepWrapper installs a tool to $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Tools, a library
(libGSWrapper) to $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Libraries, and an application / GUI
for creating and editing wrappers in $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Applications.

Now, update the available services for GWorkspace.app:
$ make_services

You may need to restart GWorkspace to make it stick.

If everything went well, you will have two new entries in GWorkspace.app's
"Services" menu: WrapperFactory > Create Wrapper / Edit Wrapper.


USAGE
=====

Create a Wrapper
----------------

1. Browse to the application binary you want to wrap.

2. Select the binary and hit "Services > WrapperFactoryWrapper > Create
   Wrapper". WrapperFactory will launch and create a basic wrapper for the
   application you selected.

3. If applicable, use the "Start" dropdown to change the application's
   behaviour when starting by opening a file ("Start Application and Open
   Files") and when opening additional files ("Open Files in Running
   Application"). The code used for the selected file to be opened is "$@",
   including the " ".

   EXAMPLE: Gimp
   Start Application: exec /usr/bin/gimp
   Start Application and Open Files: exec /usr/bin/gimp "$@"
   Open Files in Running Application: exec /usr/bin/gimp-remote "$@"

4. Add your wrapped application's app-icon by dragging it from a GWorkspace
   window to the "AppIcon" area. By default, WrapperFactory uses the GNUstep
   logo as app-icon. Supported image formats are GIF, JPEG, PNG, XPM and
   TIFF (non-compressed). As of now, overlarge images are not properly
   scaled, hence you should chose a 48x48px image as your app-icon. You can
   also use preview images provided by Inspector.app by dragging the preview
   to the "AppIcon" area.

5. If you feel like it, add application specific meta-information to the
   fields in the upper part of WrapperFactory's window and define the
   application's role (none, editor, viewer). This information is not
   necessary for creating a working app-wrapper.

Add File Types
--------------

1. Click the "Types" tab to edit the file types to be associated with your
   wrapped application.

2. Hit the "New Type" button. The right side of WrapperFactory's window will
   show you a drag-and-drop area for the file icon, and two text fields for
   extensions and file type names to be supported by the wrapped
   application.

3. Enter the file type extensions in the "Extensions" field. You can use
   comma (,) to seperate multiple extensions. Extensions are case
   insensitive.

4. Next, enter the proper name of the file type in the "Name" field.

   EXAMPLE: HTML
   Extensions: htm,html,xhtml
   Name: Hypertext Markup Language File

5. Add the icon for the file type you are creating, using drag-and-drop from
   a GWorkspace window. By default, WrapperFactory uses the GNUstep logo as
   file type icon. Supported image formats are GIF, JPEG, PNG, XPM and TIFF
   (non-compressed). As of now, overlarge images are not properly scaled,
   hence you should chose a 48x48px image as your file type icon. You can
   also use preview images provided by Inspector.app by dragging the preview
   to the "Icon" area.

6. Hit "New Type" for adding further file types, or "Delete Type" to get rid
   of a superfluous file type.


When you're done configuring your app-wrapper, use "Document > Save" to save
the wrapper. By default, WrapperFactory saves wrapped applications in
~/GNUstep/Applications/. Naturally, you can move all wrapped applications to
wherever you see fit.


Edit a Wrapper
--------------

1. Browse to the wrapped application you want to edit.

2. Select the application and hit "Services > WrapperFactory > Edit
   Wrapper". WrapperFactory will launch, opening the previously created
   app-wrapper.

3. Make your changes. You have all the same options as described above.

4. Save your edited app-wrapper by using "Document > Save" or "Document >
   Save As".
