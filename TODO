* [BUG] Crashes

  WrapperFactory.app still crashes from time to time, e.g. when
  opening a wrapped application while WrapperFactory is
  running already.


* [BUG] File Types

  The file type description is only shown in the table after the
  window has been resized at least once.


* [BUG] Create / Edit wrapper

  Do not open two WrapperFactory.app windows if WrapperFactory is not
  running already.


* [FEATURE] Icon scaling

  As of now, icon images larger than 48x48px are stored in their
  original formats assuming that the window manager will rescale them.
  However, Window Maker doesn't, so WrapperFactory should rescale.
  WrapperFactory.app will rescale such icons to 48x48px while creating
  a new app-wrapper and save both the original icon file and the
  scaled version in the app-wrapper.


* [DOC] Provide the documentation in HelpViewer.app format.


* [FEATURE] Freedesktop integration

  There are many ways of realising this:

  - import .desktop files to create wrappers

  - directly use .desktop files ("Use .desktop" action)


* [FEATURE] Scriptability

  For automation of wrapper creation, WrapperFactory should be
  scriptable. Three possible approaches:

  - enable WrapperFactory for StepTalk

  - move wrapper handling out to a library and create a command line
    tool

  - both


* [FEATURE] File type library

  Store previously defined file types and icon associations and show
  said file types when creating and editing an app-wrapper. Could be
  done with Freedesktop integration.


* [FEATURE] Multiple instances

  Some wrappers, e.g. xpdf or gv, should actually launch
  several instances of the application to simulate multiple open
  files.


* [FEATURE] More messages

  Implement more messages like e.g. applicationShouldTerminate.


* [FEATURE] Window tracking

  Try tracking windows opened by a wrapped application to keep control
  of said windows (hiding, move up in window stack etc.). Maybe in
  collaboration with Window Maker?

* [FEATURE] DE integration

  Check whether a wrapper could map GNUstep messages to GNOME/KDE
  messages.
